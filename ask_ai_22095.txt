Good [morning/afternoon/evening] everyone,

I hope you are all doing well today. As some of you may know, today is my last day working with this incredible team. It has been an honor and a privilege to work alongside each and every one of you.

I will always cherish the memories we have created together, the challenges we have overcome, and the successes we have celebrated. You are all incredibly talented individuals, and I have no doubt that you will continue to achieve great things in the future.

As I move on to new opportunities, please know that I will carry with me the lessons I have learned and the friendships I have made here. I look forward to staying in touch and seeing all the amazing things you will accomplish in the days ahead.

Thank you once again for everything. I will miss each and every one of you, and I wish you all the very best in your future endeavors.
